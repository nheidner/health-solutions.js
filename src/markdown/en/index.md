        Together, we develop a therapy plan that is individually tailored to
        your needs. Healing processes are thereby supported in a gentle way and
        your self-healing powers are released. This method can also complement
        or accompany an existing conventional medical treatment without
        influencing it.


        In this context, we expressly point out that you should under no circumstances discontinue medically advised or already ongoing treatments or stop taking medications that have been prescribed to you without medical advice.

      Every naturopathic therapy is preceded by a well-founded investigation of
      the causes. Our approach is not aimed at treating a single acute problem
      or a specific disease, but rather to get a holistic picture of them.


      For all complaints there are one or more triggers, some of which can accumulate and intensify over the years. Through our method based on root cause research, these triggers and thus your complaints are treatable. With the method we use, it is possible to identify dysfunctions and inflammatory foci in the body and to show the connection to diseases that have long been forgotten.


      A focus of inflammation is a pathogenic burden, which often does not cause any direct complaints, but has a remote effect on other organs and negatively influences their function. From this circumstance follows the conclusion that rarely where complaints occur, there are also the causes. Practice shows that often more than one stress is to be found and only the interaction of all these "poison doses" leads to complaints and finally to a disease. Inflammatory foci are increasingly found in people who often feel fatigued or suffer from chronic diseases.


      Very often, inflammatory foci, especially in the teeth and in the upper part of the head, especially the ears, are not recognized and are a constant source of pathogens that continuously burden the body and thus prevent a complete recovery. With our procedure we can also recognize these and thus give the body the chance to regain its natural vitality. Even in case of acute illnesses, such as flu-like infections or gastrointestinal diseases, we can very quickly stimulate the body to activate its self-healing powers and initiate a recovery process by analyzing the pathogens.


      We want to ensure that you are informed quickly and well-founded about what is happening in your body and to regain their health and performance.

      With the method used by us and the support of the PC program specially
      developed for this purpose, even the smallest impairments in the body,
      chronic inflammatory foci and interference fields triggered by viruses,
      bacteria, fungi, etc. can be detected, analyzed and sustainably treated. A
      reliable picture of the condition of your body is provided, in which all
      important organ systems are recorded. Even the smallest problem areas can
      be found and connections to your symptoms uncovered. For all complaints
      there are triggers that can intensify over the years and become manifest
      in the body. The goal is to gradually dissolve this.


      Our years of experience have shown that it is necessary to eliminate the chronic inflammatory foci and bacterial or viral interference fields in order to enable a holistic recovery. Without this, the body is not able to deal with the challenges of everyday life, as well as other psychological and physical ailments.
